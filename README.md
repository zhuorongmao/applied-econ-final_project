1. If you prefer running python script, all you need to download are 3 files: requirements.txt, main.py, and function_library.py, and nothing else. Use ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to recreate the environment. Then, run main.py. 

2. If you prefer running R, you need to download all the files. Then open r-script.R and restore the r environment with 
```renv::restore()```  and run r-script.R.
